## Workflow

This project was quite frustrating. In the instructional Readme, we were told to deploy to Github pages. Our instructor mentioned that you should be depoloying at the root of your Github so that you get a nice, clean URL. This sounded great but we had been given no instructions on how to do this. Our instructor told us to name the repo in a specific way so that it'd be the root of your repo. No big deal there. The issue came when we tried to follow the deployment instructions given in our Readme. To say they were not helpful would be kind. They were terrible! So many classmates had issues with it to the point that our instructor and TAs told us to not bother deploying to Github pages and just use Heroku. The frustrating bit was this was told to us after a week of us trying to get Github pages to work. Which had happened the week before on our previous homework. Which we were eventually told to deploy to Heroku instead of Github pages.

Once that got sorted, I stashed my previous repo because it was not working. I renamed it so that I could use the root name of my Github. After installing my React app, I created components and pages based on how I understood the instructional Readme. I also removed all the unnecessary React parts that are installed.
