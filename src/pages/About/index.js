        As a professional photographer, I have chosen to complete a Full Stack
        Web Development Coding Certificate from the University of Washington.
        After learning the foundations for web development in this course, I
        plan to combine these with the skills and experience I have gained as a
        photographer. I know that my attention to details, self motivation and
        love of technology will make me a valuable employee.
