          As a professional photographer, I have chosen to complete a Full Stack
          Web Development Coding Certificate from the University of Washington.
          After learning the foundations for web development in this course, I
          plan to combine these with the skills and experience I have gained as
          a photographer. I know that my attention to details, self motivation
          and love of technology will make me a valuable employee.
